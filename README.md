# AI-ML-Notebooks
This repository contains notebooks explaining the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence as well as Machine Learning and Big Data. In these notebooks, problem-solving and serach algorithms such as A*, Heuristic search have been explained. Concepts such as Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Basics of natural language processing, computer vision and robotics have been elaborated.
Furthermore, Supervised and Unsupervised learning (classification, regression, clustering) have been explored.
Deep learning frameworks for handling complex data patterns have also been touched on.
Big data ecosystems such as Hadoop, Spark and Kafka for distributing processsing have also carried out and tested in a project designed to detect malware in the Kenyan Financial Infrastructure.
