This notebook demonstrates fundamental text preprocessing techniques commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## Current Functionalities:

- **Lowercasing**: Converts all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity and reduce the vocabulary size.
- **Removing Punctuations**: Eliminates common punctuation marks from the text.
- **Removing Special Characters**: Removes various special characters that might not be relevant for analysis.
- **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words or tokens.
